Spidermon is a recommended tool for monitoring spiders created using Scrapy. The user at the time can choose between two libraries for item validation rules: jsonschema and schematics. We want to provide a third option that being Cerberus.

Cerberus provides powerful yet simple and lightweight data validation functionality out of the box and is designed to be easily extensible, allowing for custom validation. It has no dependencies and is thoroughly tested on several Python versions.

The goal of this project was to integrate, test and enable Cerberus as a new option for item validation available for the user.
